        Cloud  computing  has  a  great  capability to boost 
productivity  and  minimize  costs,  hence  many  companies  are 
embracing  it, but at the same time it constitutes many security 
security risks and challenges.  Due to possibilities of multiple 
risks  such  as  service  outage,  theft  of  data, data leakage  and 
the  chances  of malicious insider  attack,  using  single cloud is 
becoming  obnoxious  by  many  companies  and  new  notion  of 
Multi-Clouds  usage  is  becoming  perceptible  to  cope  with
these  security  issues.  This  paper  demonstrates  powerful 
security  strategy  of  using  DNA  based  cryptography  which 
ensures secure data storage on Multi-Clouds.

        Cloud  computing  offers  real  benefits  to  companies 
seeking  a  competitive  edge  in  today's  economy,  but 
obstruction  to cloud implementation is security challenges
and  risks.  By  splitting  user's  critical  data  in to  parts  and 
then  applying powerful DNA  based cryptography  to  each 
part  of  data  and  ultimately  uploading  it  on  multiple 
clouds;  this  strategy  has  shown  its  ability of providing  a 
cloud  user  with a more secured storage.  Future scope for 
this work is implementation of virus scanner and malware
detector  and  embedding  it  within  application.  This  will
prevent  uploading  of  any  malicious  data.    However,  the 
implemented  concepts are definitely beneficial in building
strong  cloud  security  architecture.  This  will 
certainly  meet  with  customer's  expectations  and  will 
attract  more  investors  for  industrial  as  well  as  future 
research farms.
